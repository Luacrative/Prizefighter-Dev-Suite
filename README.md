# Prizefighter Dev Suite

## Overview

This Blender addon is a tool developed for use with my Roblox games, particularly Prizefighter. It provides a streamlined workflow to export animations in a custom text format that seamlessly integrates with Prizefighter's custom animation system.

I developed this back in late 2021. It was my first real project in Python, and I thought it would be nice to share :)

## Features

- **Bone locking:** Create IK-like constraints while using FK, with config saving and loading.
- **Offset system:** Easily adjust many animation poses at once.
- **Export .fbx Animations:** Convert animations into a custom Roblox-supported format.
- **FPS slider and model visibility toggles.**

## Future Plans

- Make the bone config editable from the plugin itself.
- Ability to edit the models that the visibility toggles adjust.
- Broaden the scope of the addon.
